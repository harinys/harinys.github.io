            <p>It is a perfect mix of hybrid efficent with the premium luxury that is all expected from Lexus. This car is at an affordable price even with the extra comfortness.</p>
            <p>The car includes a 1.5 litre preold engine which works along with an electic motor. The engine is able to sustain and go at higher powers compared to its Toyota sibling with speeds of up to 62mph.</p>
            <p>The LBX is highly susitainable as it switches between the two power sources. Interior is constructed with high-quality material and space for leg rest and others. The minimalist clean dashboard keeps things more easier to look and do, such as changing temperature.</p>
            <p>Though small it has enough space to allow passanger for leg stetch and around six carry-on suicases are abke to fir below the LBX's parcel shelf.</p>
            <p>It has finished the race on whatcar.com survey of the most reliable new cars.</p>

            <h2>(4) Renault Clio</h2>
            <h3>Reliability: 4/5 Safety: 4/5 Cost: 5/5 Quality: 4/5 Performance: 3/5</h3>
            <h4>Strengths: Smart interior is packed with equipment, good ride and handling balance, and practical boot</h4>
            <h4>Weaknesses: Tight for taller adults in the rear seats, slighly firm low-spped ride and high boot loading lip</h4>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>It is currently Britain's best small car and has been popular for generations</p>
            <p>You are able to choose between regular pretol or hybrid power in the Clio. With the former's 1.0-litre three-cylinder setup, it ogger just 90bhp and can sprint from 0-62mph in relatively leisurely 12.3sec. It is perfect for a dash aroung town.</p>
            <p>The hybrid on the other hand produces 143bhp from its petrol engine and electric motor, giving a faster feel.</p>
            <p>Steering here is no doubt better than rivals Fabia or Vauxhall, ebing able to see what the front wheels are up to as you drive along.</p>
            <p>With low prics as well as low running cost it has everything you needed even with an entry-level Evolution trim.</p>
            <h4>Current car deal for Renault Clio:</h4>
            <h5>TARGET PRICES FROM £16126 OR FROM £187PM</h5>

            <h2>(3) Kia EV6</h2>
            <h3>Reliability: 4/5 Safety: 4/5 Costs: 4/5 Quality: 4/5 Performance: 4/5</h3>
            <h4>Strengths: Long range and fast charging, loads of rear legroom and seven-year Kia warranty</h4>
            <h4>Weaknesses: Shallow boot, expensive top rim and slighly firm ride</h4>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>This remains to be one of the best eletric cars around, as is a favourite electric SUV</p>
            <p>A stellar rang of us to 328 miles, and up to 270 in real-world conditions- but it's also fast. The cheapest RWD versions come with a single 226bhp motor, managed to out-do rival Volkswagen ID-4 and Nissan Ariya up to 60mph. AWD models gwts a second motor, upping the total power to 321bhp.</p>
            <p>If you wamt to go faster, the range-topping EV6 GT gets 577bhp and can hit 62mph in 3.5sec- but sacrifices some range output during the output.</p>
            <p>The EV6's ride if firm, but trade-off is taugher body control, meaning it's more engaging to drive than other mainstream electric SUVs. That's helped by string grip  and being slightly lowerthan most rivals. We also ge a better feel from steering. </p>
            <p>Given the orice, the EV6 has finely created interior which beats the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 for qualoty, mathcing up to the Audi Q4 e-tron. The spaciousness with more headroom for passengers.</p>
            <p>There's nice amount of space for luggage area, with enough space for an overnight bag and even shopping.</p>

            <h4>Strengths: Low CO2 emissions and great fuel economy, comfortable ride and loads of standard kit</h4>
            <h4>Weaknesses: Cramped in the back, so-so infotainment system and 12.3in digital instrument cluster could be easier to use</h4>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Great family car. Low running costs, offered by its hybrid setup and resale values are predicted to be high, resulting in low monstly PCP finace costs. </p>
            <p>The corollo has more than enough performance for everyday drving, will easily keep up with motorway traffic.</p>
            <p>The brawnier 2.0litre version drops the 0-62mph sprint time to a respectable 7.4sec, which makes to faster than most versions of the rival. Yoy drive arounf short dstances-suaully around town and mainly will be on electric power.</p>
            <p>The Corolla's ride quality beats even the syper-comfy Ford Focys.</p>
            <p>The thin windscreen meaning looking out of the Corolla at junctions is a breeze.</p>
